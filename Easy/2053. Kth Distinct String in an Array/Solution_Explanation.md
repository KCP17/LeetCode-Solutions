## 2. Algorithms
* HashMap
* Counting

## 3. Code (with inline explanation)
```python3 []
class Solution:
    def kthDistinct(self, arr: List[str], k: int) -> str:
        freq_map = Counter(arr) # a Counting HashMap that maps each letter to its frequency
        for s in arr:
            if freq_map[s] == 1: # If a letter appears only once (aka it has the frequency of 1)
                k -= 1 # Decrement `k` until..
                if k == 0: # `k` reaches 0, means this is the Kth appear-once letter
                    return s # Return that letter
        return "" # If no letter had been returned, then return an empty string
```

## 4. Complexity
- Time complexity: $$O(n)$$
- Space complexity: $$O(n)$$
